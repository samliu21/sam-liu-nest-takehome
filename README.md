## Sam Liu Nest Take-home

I finished both part (1) and (2).

I didn't get to styling, and for displaying the comments, I didn't have time to use react-router to create a seperate URL, so I just modified in place. To hide the comments and show the original list, just refresh the page.

## Run Instructions
Just run "npm start"
